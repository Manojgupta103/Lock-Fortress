# Lock-Fortress

Project Name: Lock Fortress
Description:

The Secure Password Manager and Strength Checker project is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance user security and convenience in managing their online accounts and passwords. The project consists of two main components: a password manager and a password strength checker, both built with a strong focus on data security and usability.
Password Manager:

The password manager is a web-based application accessible across multiple devices. It allows users to securely store and manage their login credentials for various online accounts. Key features of the password manager include:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account with a master password, which is securely hashed and stored.

Adminstrator:-The creditionals shown to the admin are encryted,this means that even the admin will not have any access to the credtionals.

Credential Management: Users can add, edit, and delete account credentials. Each set of credentials includes fields for the account name, username, password, and URL.

Encryption: Strong encryption  is employed to protect user data, ensuring that all stored credentials remain confidential and secure.

Password Generation: A built-in password generator provides users with the ability to create strong and unique passwords for their accounts. Users can customize password criteria such as length, character types, and symbol inclusion.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The password manager is accessible on desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that users can access their credentials from anywhere with an internet connection.

Data Synchronization: Robust synchronization mechanisms ensure data consistency across devices. Data transmission during synchronization is protected using end-to-end encryption.

Password Strength Checker:
Users input a password, and the program evaluates it based on criteria ZXCVBN, which is open-source password strength estimator library.
Strength Rating Scale: The program categorizes passwords into strength levels which is evaluated on point based approach.
